# DSCV: Double Sampling Cross Validation Framework

By the co-work of Yuchen Zhu and Siyu Gao

This repo contains all the code implementation and experiment details for the project DSCV: Unknown Unknown Detection in Imbalance Learning, which is an algorithmic framework that can address both imbalanced learning and open set recognition at the same time.

  + sampling.py contains the code that run the experiments on the combination of DSCV with different sampling methods
  + ensemble.py contains the code that runs the experiments on the combination of RTSCV with different ensemble classifier implemented with [Imbalanced-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn/tree/master/imblearn)
  + more_ensemble.py contains the code that runs the experiments on the combination of RTSCV with different ensemble classifier implemented with [Awesome-imbalanced-learning](https://github.com/ZhiningLiu1998/awesome-imbalanced-learning)
### To-start
* All code are written in Python.
* Download the repo by
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:zyc4975matholic/DSCV.git
  cd DSCV
  ```
* Install all dependencies by
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Test the code by
  ```
  python DSCV.py
  ```

### Initialize a DSCV instance
* To intialize a DSCV instance the following parameter has to be passed
  + classifier: a classifier object(not instance) that at least implement fit and predict methods, default = SVC
  + kwargs: a dictionary that contains the parameter-value pairs used to generate the classifier, default = default setting of SVC
  + sample_rate: a float between 0 and 1, indicates the test sample size, default = 0.2
  + k_fold: a int larger than 2, indicates the number of folds in cross validation, default = 3
  + resampler: a str that indicates the sampling strategy. Must be one of the following, default = "SMOTE"
      - "ClusterCentroids"
      - "CondensedNearestNeighbour"
      - "EditedNearestNeighbours"
      - "RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours"
      - "AllKNN" 
      - "InstanceHardnessThreshold"
      - "NearMiss"
      - "NeighbourhoodCleaningRule"
      - "OneSidedSelection"
      - "RandomUnderSampler"
      - "TomekLinks"
      - "SVM-SMOTE"
      - "ADASYN"
      - "KMeansSMOTE"
      - "BorderlineSMOTE"
      - "RandomOverSampler"
      - "SMOTE"
      - "SMOTEENN"
      - "SMOTETomek"

### Trainning with DSCV
* use method meta_fit, passing in X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test
  return a trained model with DSCV

### Predict with DSCV
* use method predict, passing X,
  return a numpy array with predicted labels, label with 99 are unknown unknowns found by DSCV
